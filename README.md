# APK Reverse TCP Embedder
This PyQt5-based application facilitates embedding reverse TCP payloads into APK files, leveraging Metasploit.

## Features:
User Interface: Simple GUI for user interaction.
Payload Generation: Generates reverse TCP payload using Metasploit.
Payload Embedding: Embeds the payload into the APK file.
Validation: Validates the APK file extension.
Progress Tracking: Provides progress feedback during embedding.
Error Handling: Catches errors such as file not found or marker not found.
Success Notification: Informs users upon successful embedding.
## Instructions:
### Run the script using Python.
Select an APK file using the "Choose File" button.
Enter the IP address and port for the reverse TCP connection.
Click "Embed Reverse TCP" to initiate the embedding process.
Follow on-screen prompts for further actions.
## Dependencies:
PyQt5==5.15.4
Install metasploit

pip install PyQt5
msfconsole
import zipfile
Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the script.

## Note:
Replace the placeholder embedding logic with your actual implementation.
Handle exceptions and edge cases as required for robustness.
